## Work Completed

### Repository Structure
- **What was done:**
  - Created organized directory structure with numbered folders (100-architecture, 150-workflow, 200-features, 300-agents)
  - Moved existing documentation to appropriate folders:
    - `architecture-overview.md` → `docs/100-architecture/`
    - `project-philosophy.md` → `docs/150-workflow/`
    - `workflow-rules.md` → `docs/150-workflow/`
  - Created Python/VSCode `.gitignore` file
  - Updated `README.md` with project structure and branching strategy
- **Commits:** 
  - [In progress - bootstrap phase]

### Core Documentation
- **What was done:**
  - Created `docs/150-workflow/context-management.md` with:
    - Bite-sized increment practices
    - Decision logging format
    - Structured memory bundle approach
    - Session boundary ritual
    - Inter-agent Q&A patterns
  - Created `docs/200-features/FEATURE-0001-agent-playbook-foundations.md` with:
    - Overview and goals
    - Scope definition
    - Agent roles summary
    - Tooling requirements and blockers
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Decision log structure
  - Created comprehensive agent playbooks in `docs/300-agents/`:
    - `architect.md` - Design & specification
    - `orchestrator.md` - Task coordination & memory management
    - `coder.md` - Implementation
    - `tester.md` - Test creation & validation
    - `documentation-specialist.md` - Documentation maintenance
    - `reviewer.md` - Quality assurance

### Daily Log System
- **What was done:**
  - Created `docs/daily-logs/TEMPLATE.md` with structured sections for:
    - Status tracking
    - Work completed
    - Decisions made
    - Blockers
    - Questions/open items
    - Next actions
    - Agent activity summary
    - Optional metrics
  - Created this daily log (2025-12-12.md)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact | Logged In |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Use numbered doc folders (100-, 150-, 200-, 300-) | Provides clear logical ordering and prevents alphabetical chaos | Easier navigation and discovery of documentation | FEATURE-0001 |
| Separate agent playbooks in 300-agents/ | Each role needs distinct guidance; avoids one massive document | Clear separation of concerns; easier to update individual roles | FEATURE-0001 |
| Defer custom tool implementation | Letta API blockers prevent immediate implementation | Focus on documentation foundation first; revisit tools later | FEATURE-0001 |
| Daily logs use YYYY-MM-DD.md naming | Sortable, unambiguous, follows standard date format | Easy to find logs chronologically | FEATURE-0001 |
| Bootstrap phase allows direct commits to main | Speed up initial setup; switch to feature branches once foundation is ready | Foundation established quickly; normal workflow begins after bootstrap | README.md |

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Status | Owner |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Letta tool creation API errors | Cannot implement custom `repo_write_file`, `git_runner`, `test_runner` tools | Active | External (Letta API) |
| No test framework set up yet | Cannot validate code implementations | Acknowledged | Future task |
| No CI/CD pipeline | Cannot automate testing and validation | Acknowledged | Future task |

---

## Questions / Open Items

- [ ] Should we add a Night Crew specific playbook in 300-agents/?
- [ ] What Python version and dependencies should we standardize on?
- [ ] Do we need a separate "onboarding" doc for new agents joining the team?
- [ ] Should there be a cross-reference index for quickly finding related docs?

---

## Next Actions

**Immediate (Next Session):**
1. Review all created documentation for consistency and completeness
2. Make initial commits following conventional commit format
3. Set up feature branch workflow (no more direct commits to main)
4. Begin FEATURE-0002 planning (likely: Python project setup & tooling)

**Upcoming (This Week):**
- Define Python project structure (src/ layout, __init__.py files, etc.)
- Set up basic test framework (pytest)
- Create first simple agent implementation to validate playbook effectiveness
- Establish git workflow with actual feature branches

**Deferred:**
- Custom Letta tool implementation (blocked on API)
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Integration testing framework
- Night crew operational setup

---

## Notes / Context

**Bootstrap Phase Approach:**
- This is a special phase where we're establishing the foundation
- Direct commits to main are allowed temporarily for speed
- Once foundation is complete, strict feature branch workflow begins
- All agent playbooks are now documented but untested in practice
- These playbooks will evolve as we learn from actual usage

**Documentation Philosophy:**
- Documentation is complete enough to guide agents without being prescriptive
- Each playbook includes failure modes and mitigations based on anticipated issues
- Decision logs are emphasized throughout to prevent future confusion
- Context management is a first-class concern to avoid LLM context overflow
