T2-07	Emotion-Aware Style	Tone-modulated responses	Orchestrator passes mood tags to LLM → different tone (gentle, concise, etc.).	T2-06, T1-03, T1-10	\[ ]

T2-08	KB Ingest	Document ingestion \& parsing	Import PDFs/docs/notes; extract text and store.	File system	\[ ]

T2-09	KB Search (RAG)	Embeddings \& retrieval	Build local vector index; allow “search my docs on X”.	T2-08, embeddings model	\[ ]

T2-10	Work Support	Summaries \& action items from docs/meetings	LLM reads docs/notes and produces summaries, risks, action items.	T2-09, T1-02	\[ ]

T2-13	Contacts DB	Basic CRM	Contact table (name, relation, notes, birthdays).	Local DB	\[ ]

T2-14	Social Support	Relationship-aware replies	Use contact info + Letta to tailor responses/recs about people.	T2-13, T1-07, T1-02	\[ ]

T2-15	Proactive Alerts (Basic)	Upcoming deadlines \& events prompts	Background job that surfaces “3 deadlines this week”-type alerts.	T2-01, T2-04, T1-11	\[ ]

🔴 Tier 3 – Next-Gen Personal Assistant



Goal: proactive, identity-aware, schedule-shuffling, “bigger than its size” assistant.



ID	Category	Feature	Description	Depends On	Status

T3-02	Advanced Proactivity	Daily “What matters today?” brief	Background agent checks tasks, calendar, KB, and crafts a brief prioritized daily summary.	T2-01, T2-04, T2-09, T3-01, T1-02	\[ ]

T3-03	Proactive Schedule Management	Reschedule \& shuffle intelligently	Detect overload/conflicts, propose or auto-shuffle events/tasks based on priorities, energy, constraints.	T2-01, T2-04, T3-01, T2-06	\[ ]
