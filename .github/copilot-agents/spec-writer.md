# Spec Writer

Updates files with specific changes while you focus on other work.

## When to Use

Use @spec-writer when you need to:
- Update a file with specific content while you continue working elsewhere
- Apply routine changes to documentation or config files
- Add entries to logs or update status in multiple files
- Make parallel updates without context switching

## Example

"@spec-writer update the daily log with today's work: added database schema, wrote tests for user auth, blocked on API rate limiting"

That's it. Just tell it what to update and where.
